# **United States Carbon Emissions**

## Introduction
This is a comprehensive repository containing carbon emissions data for the United States. The data used was compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency, providing valuable insights into the nation's carbon emissions trends over this period. This repository serves as a vital resource for researchers, policymakers, and environmental enthusiasts seeking to understand and analyze the impact of carbon emissions on the environment and public health.

## Findings
Utilizing the data subset I created, I was able to clearly visualize the carbon emissions emitted in the United States. 

**Data Visualizations** 
I was able to specifically pinpoint which states and which facilities produce the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The first data visualizaiton demonstrates what industries emmit the most carbon emissions into the atmosphere. The second

**Why is this useful?**

This could policymakers and environmental agencies to identify geographical areas and specific facilities that are major contributors to carbon emissions. This information is crucial for targeting efforts to reduce emissions effectively.
Setting Priorities: With clear visualization and data analysis, decision-makers can prioritize their efforts and resources towards the states or facilities with the highest emissions. This can lead to more efficient allocation of funds and implementation of emission reduction strategies.

## Contents
The original CSV file is included, containing raw data provided by thh EPA. The original dataset encompasses a wide range of locations in the US and different emission levels. Access the data set here: [Original Air Emission Data Set](https://github.com/rokaya02/US-Air-Emissions/blob/00e76178f7b7ba4369969c4e0f499bd29436eb6c/data/original%20data/air_emissions1.csv)


The subset created from the origincal CSV file narrowed the air emissions looked at to specify in carbon emissions. Access this data set here: [New Air Emission Data Set](https://github.com/rokaya02/US-Air-Emissions/blob/27bc03e0a0a7c8f252e3dcda7dddd5b895b418f1/data/new%20subset/air_emissions_subset.csv) In addition to this, [Google CoLab](https://colab.google/) was used to create this subset.


Along with the new subset of data, there are instructions on how to replicate this with detailed explanations. Find the python notebook here: [Notebook](https://github.com/rokaya02/US-Air-Emissions/blob/00e76178f7b7ba4369969c4e0f499bd29436eb6c/Rokaya_Air_Emissions.ipynb)

To generally navigate this repository, note that everything is in folders. The original data set and new data set can both be found in the [data](https://github.com/rokaya02/US-Air-Emissions/tree/27bc03e0a0a7c8f252e3dcda7dddd5b895b418f1/data) folder. The [data visualizations](https://github.com/rokaya02/US-Air-Emissions/tree/27bc03e0a0a7c8f252e3dcda7dddd5b895b418f1/Data%20Visualizations) folder has two files containing two different data visualizations that were created using the data subset I created through Google CoLab.
